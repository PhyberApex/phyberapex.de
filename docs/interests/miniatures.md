# Miniature Painting Gallery

Welcome to my tiny world! Here's where I showcase my miniature painting projects and how this hobby intertwines with my love for board games.

## The Art of Miniature Painting

Miniature painting is my meditation. It's a perfect blend of creativity, patience, and attention to detail - skills that complement my work in software development.

## Featured Projects

- **Zombicide Survivors and Zombies**: Bringing life (and undeath) to the characters from one of my favorite board games.
- **Gloomhaven Characters**: Personalizing the heroes of this epic campaign game.

## Miniatures in Gaming

My miniature painting hobby directly enhances my board gaming experience:

- **Zombicide**: Painting the survivors and zombies adds a personal touch to the game.
- **Gloomhaven**: Custom-painted characters make the campaign feel more immersive.

## Current Project

I'm working on painting the massive collection of miniatures that came with my Zombicide games. It's a long-term project that I chip away at between other gaming sessions.

## Community Involvement

- Sharing painting progress and tips in board game forums
- Planning to showcase painted miniatures at future board game nights

## Storage and Display

I use a combination of 3D printed storage solutions (like the OMNI 2 and ModiBOXI systems) and a few IKEA _HARVMATTA_ shelves.
