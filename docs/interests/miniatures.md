# Miniature Painting Gallery

Welcome to my tiny world! Here's where I showcase my miniature painting projects, techniques, and how this hobby intertwines with my love for board games.

## The Art of Miniature Painting

Miniature painting is my meditation. It's a perfect blend of creativity, patience, and attention to detail - skills that complement my work in software development.

## Featured Projects

1. **Zombicide Survivors and Zombies**: Bringing life (and undeath) to the characters from one of my favorite board games.
2. **Gloomhaven Characters**: Personalizing the heroes of this epic campaign game.
3. **Custom D&D Party**: Although I haven't started playing yet, I'm preparing by painting potential character miniatures.

## Techniques I Love

- **Base Coating**: Creating a solid foundation for the miniature's color scheme.
- **Dry Brushing**: Adding depth and highlighting raised areas.
- **Washing**: Using thin, dark paints to add shadows and definition.

## My Painting Setup

- **Paints**: Primarily Army Painter with a few Citadel effect paints
- **Brushes**: A mix of affordable synthetic brushes for base coats and higher quality sable brushes for detail work
- **Lighting**: Desk lamp and an Elgato Key Pro for true color representation

## Miniatures in Gaming

My miniature painting hobby directly enhances my board gaming experience:

- **Zombicide**: Painting the survivors and zombies adds a personal touch to the game.
- **Gloomhaven**: Custom-painted characters make the campaign feel more immersive.

## Current Project

I'm working on painting the massive collection of miniatures that came with my Zombicide games. It's a long-term project that I chip away at between other gaming sessions.

## Painting Tips for Beginners

1. Thin your paints! Multiple thin layers are better than one thick layer.
2. Invest in a good quality brush and take care of it.
3. Don't be afraid to experiment with different techniques.
4. Patience is key - take breaks to avoid eye strain and maintain steady hands.

## Community Involvement

- Sharing painting progress and tips in board game forums
- Planning to showcase painted miniatures at future board game nights

## Storage and Display

I use a combination of 3D printed storage solutions (like the OMNI 2 and ModiBOXI systems) and a few IKEA _HARVMATTA_ shelves.
