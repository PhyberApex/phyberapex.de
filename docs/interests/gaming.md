# My Tabletop Gaming Universe

Welcome to my analog playground! Here's where I share my passion for board games, my budding interest in Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), and how I use 3D printing to enhance my gaming experience.

## Board Game Collection Highlights

1. **Zombicide**: My go-to game for cooperative zombie-slaying action. I love the miniatures and the intense gameplay.
2. **Gloomhaven**: An epic campaign game that offers deep strategic gameplay and an evolving story.
3. **Final Girl**: A solo horror movie-inspired game that delivers tension and excitement in every play session.

## Favorite Game Mechanics

- **Cooperative Play**: Working together with friends to overcome challenges.
- **Deck Building Elements**: Games that evolve and change permanently as you play.
- **Miniature-based Games**: Combining my love for miniatures with strategic gameplay.

## 3D Printed Storage Solutions

I've embraced 3D printing technology to optimize my board game storage and organization. While I don't design the solutions myself, I've found some fantastic systems online:

- **OMNI 2 System**: A versatile, modular storage solution that I've printed for several games. It's great for organizing small components and cards.
- **ModiBOXI**: Another modular system I use, which offers excellent flexibility for storing various game pieces.
- **Game-Specific Inlays**: I've printed various inlays found online, custom-designed for specific games in my collection.

These 3D printed solutions have revolutionized my game storage, making setup and cleanup much more efficient. I'm always on the lookout for new designs to print and try out!

## TTRPG Journey

I'm just starting my journey into the world of Tabletop Role-Playing Games. While I only had a few sessions so far, I'm excited about the possibilities:

- **Systems of Interest**: Bunkers and Badasses, Kids on Bikes, Dungeons & Dragons
- **Character Ideas**: A few concepts brewing, including a quirky gnome artificer and a brooding tiefling warlock
- **Preparation**: Reading rulebooks, watching actual play videos, and crafting my first character sheet

## Gaming Setup

- **Organizers**: Various 3D printed organizers and containers to keep game components tidy
- **Lighting**: Adjustable overhead lighting for the perfect ambiance

## Video Gaming

While no longer a primary hobby, I still enjoy the occasional video game session:

- **Current Favorite**: Borderlands Series
- **Go-to Relaxation Game**: Rocket League

## Future Plans

- Hosting a regular board game night with friends
