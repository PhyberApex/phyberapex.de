# My Vinyl OST Collection

Dive into the world of video game and anime music with me! Here's where I showcase my ever-growing collection of soundtracks on vinyl.

## Why Vinyl?

There's something magical about the warmth of vinyl that perfectly complements the nostalgia of video game and anime music. Plus, the artwork is simply stunning at 12" size!

## Collection Highlights

1. **Transistor (Darren Korb)**: One of my absolute favorites, with its unique blend of electronic and acoustic elements.
2. **VA-11 HALL-A (Garoad)**: A cyberpunk masterpiece that perfectly captures the game's atmospheric bar setting.
3. **Borderlands 2 (Jesper Kyd, et al.)**: My latest addition, bringing the chaotic world of Pandora to life.
4. **Guild Wars (Jeremy Soule)**: Another recent acquisition, featuring epic fantasy themes.
5. **Megalo Box (mabanua)**: A gritty, hip-hop infused soundtrack that perfectly matches the anime's style.
6. **My Neighbor Totoro (Joe Hisaishi)**: A beautiful, whimsical score from the legendary Studio Ghibli film.
7. **Steins;Gate (Takeshi Abo)**: A haunting and emotional soundtrack that complements the time-travel narrative.

## Vinyl and Gaming

While I've shifted more towards board games these days, my vinyl collection remains a cherished part of my gaming experience:

- **Background Music**: Sometimes I'll play these soundtracks during board game sessions to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Zombicide Sessions**: The Borderlands 2 soundtrack is perfect for intense zombie-slaying action!
- **Relaxation**: After an intense gaming session, listening to calmer soundtracks like My Neighbor Totoro helps me unwind.

## Display

All of my vinyl OSTs are proudly mounted on the wall in my office, creating a stunning display of cover artwork. It's not just a collection, but a visual representation of my love for game and anime music.
