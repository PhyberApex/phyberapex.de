# KnowledgeNG

## Overview
KnowledgeNG is a Java fat application that allows users to create and manage their personal local wiki.

## Project Details
- **GitHub**: [Knowledge-NG](https://github.com/PhyberApex/Knowledge-NG)
- **Tech Stack**: Java, SVN
- **Status**: Discontinued (No longer needed)

## Features
- Local wiki creation and management
- User-friendly interface
- Offline access to personal knowledge base

## Development Journey
This is my very first real project I did back then. And I was trying to fill a need I was having personally. This led to where I am now with using Obsidian.

## Historical Significance
This project is now way back and I think the main thing I learned was to follow up on new tech learned and try them out as soon as possible.
