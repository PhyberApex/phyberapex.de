# LobbyBinghoe

## Overview
LobbyBinghoe is a bingo web application designed for fans of the German podcast "Hobbylos". It adds an interactive element to the podcast listening experience.

## Project Details
- **GitHub**: [LobbyBinghoe](https://github.com/PhyberApex/LobbyBinghoe)
- **Tech Stack**: Vue 3, TypeScript, Netlify, Supabase
- **Status**: Postponed (No interest gained)

## Features
- Interactive bingo board
- Real-time updates
- User-friendly interface

## Development Journey
I tried out Supabase for the first time and wanted to try some new features from Vue. I also want to use some more advanced features of Supabase like user management etc.

## Future Plans
I want to see where this is going and if this is going to get some traction in the community of the podcast (SPOILER: It did not...)
