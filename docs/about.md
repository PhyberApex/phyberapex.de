# About Me

## Who Am I?

Greetings, fellow netizens! I'm the one and only PhyberApex, a software engineering maestro by day and a multi-faceted geek by night. Welcome to my digital realm, where code meets creativity, and pixels dance to the tune of innovation.

## Professional Life

As a Principal Member of Technical Staff (PMTS) at Salesforce, I'm at the forefront of cloud-based CRM solutions. My days are filled with:

- Architecting scalable front-end solutions that make data management a breeze
- Implementing robust back-end systems that can handle whatever the cloud throws at them
- Mentoring junior developers and watching them soar (not literally, that would be weird)
- Contributing to open-source projects because sharing is caring in the world of code

While I'm a fullstack developer, my heart beats a little faster for front-end development. There's something magical about crafting interfaces that make users go "Wow!" instead of "How?"

## The Geek Side

When I'm not pushing pixels or wrangling databases, you'll find me indulging in my geeky pursuits:

### Gaming Guru
I'm an avid video game enthusiast. From epic RPGs that consume entire weekends to intense FPS games that test my reflexes, I love losing myself in digital worlds.

### Vinyl Virtuoso
There's something magical about the crackle of vinyl, especially when it's playing the soundtrack of your favorite game. My collection of video game OSTs on vinyl is my pride and joy. Current favorite? You'll have to ask!

### Miniature Maestro
Bringing tiny worlds to life is my meditation. Armed with brushes and paints, I meticulously craft miniature masterpieces. Each figurine tells a story, frozen in time and acrylic.

### Salesforce Plushie Collector
Yes, you read that right! I have an ever-growing collection of Salesforce mascot plushies. They're not just cute, they're a fluffy reminder of the awesome work we do. Current count? That's classified information!

## My Philosophy

> "Everyone thinks they are the hero of their own story" - Handsome Jack, Borderlands 2

This quote resonates with me, not because I think I'm a hero, but because it reminds me that everyone has their own perspective and journey. In the world of technology and creativity, there's no one "right" way to do things. We're all crafting our own stories, line of code by line of code, pixel by pixel.

## Let's Connect!

Whether you want to geek out about the latest tech, challenge me to a gaming duel, or just chat about the intricacies of painting miniature eyebrows, I'm always up for a good conversation.
