## The Professional: Code Conjurer & Security Sentinel 🧙‍♂️🛡️

As a Principal Member of Technical Staff (PMTS) at Salesforce, I wear multiple hats in the world of web development and security. My typical day involves:

- 🏗️ Architecting scalable front-end and back-end solutions
- 🚀 Mentoring junior developers
- 🔒 Advising on web application security

While I'm a fullstack developer, my true passions lie in front-end development (particularly in the Vue.js ecosystem) and web application security.

### Vue.js Enthusiast and Certified Developer

I'm a huge fan of the Vue.js ecosystem. Its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features make it my go-to choice for front-end development. In fact, this very website is built using VuePress, a Vue-powered static site generator!

I'm proud to be a Certified Vue Developer and Senior Vue Developer, as recognized by certificates.dev. You can view my certification [here](https://certificates.dev/vuejs/certificates/9ca17bca-7329-42a8-bd69-4bd7086c51ba).

### TypeScript Aficionado

I'm passionate about writing type-safe, robust code, and I've honed my TypeScript skills through various resources. One that I particularly enjoyed was the TypeScript workshops from Matt Pocock's [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/). These workshops have significantly enhanced my understanding and application of TypeScript in real-world scenarios.

### Web App Security Expert

I have a particular knack for web application security. As the main point of contact for security questions across multiple teams, I:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments
- 🛡️ Develop and implement security best practices
- 🧠 Educate teams on the latest security threats and mitigation strategies
- 🔍 Perform code reviews with a security-first mindset

My goal is to ensure that our web applications are not just functional and user-friendly, but also robust and secure against potential threats.

## The Geek: Multi-Faceted Enthusiast 🎲🎵🖌️

When I'm not pushing pixels, crafting Vue components, or fortifying web defenses, you'll find me indulging in my geeky pursuits:

### 🎲 Board Game & TTRPG Enthusiast
From intense zombie-slaying in Zombicide to strategic campaigns in Gloomhaven, I love diving into immersive tabletop experiences. I'm also taking my first steps into the world of TTRPGs!

### 💿 Vinyl Virtuoso
My collection of video game OSTs on vinyl is my pride and joy. Current favorite spin: *VA-11 HALL-A*

### 🎨 Miniature Maestro
Armed with brushes and paints, I meticulously craft miniature masterpieces. Each figurine tells a story, frozen in time and acrylic.

### 😺 Salesforce Plushie Collector
Yes, you read that right! I have an ever-growing collection of Salesforce mascot plushies. Current count: 16 (and growing!)

## The Family Man: My Support System ❤️🏠

When I'm not immersed in code or geeking out over board games, my heart belongs to my amazing family:

- 👩‍❤️‍👨 My incredible wife, who supports me in everything I do. She's my rock and my biggest cheerleader.
- 👦 A teenage son who keeps me on my toes and reminds me daily how fast time flies.
- 👧 A young child who fills our home with laughter and wonder, teaching me to see the world through fresh eyes.
- 🐕 And last but not least, our family mascot - Morty, our 7-year-old golden retriever. He's not just a pet; he's a full-fledged family member who even joins me for couples costumes during Halloween!

My family is the reason I strive to be better every day, both personally and professionally. They inspire me, ground me, and remind me of what's truly important in life.

## My Philosophy

> "In code, games, and family life, it's all about solving puzzles, creating experiences, and cherishing every moment."

This philosophy guides me through the complexities of software development, the excitement of gaming, and the joys and challenges of family life.
