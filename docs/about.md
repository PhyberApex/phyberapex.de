# About PhyberApex

## The Professional: Code Conjurer & Security Sentinel 🧙‍♂️🛡️

As a Principal Member of Technical Staff (PMTS) at Salesforce, I wear multiple hats in the world of web development and security. My typical day involves:

- 🏗️ Architecting scalable front-end and back-end solutions
- 🚀 Mentoring junior developers
- 🔒 Advising on web application security

While I'm a fullstack developer, my true passions lie in front-end development (particularly in the Vue.js ecosystem) and web application security.

### Vue.js Enthusiast and Certified Developer

I'm a huge fan of the Vue.js ecosystem. Its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful features make it my go-to choice for front-end development. In fact, this very website is built using VuePress, a Vue-powered static site generator!

I'm proud to be a Certified Vue Developer and Senior Vue Developer, as recognized by certificates.dev. You can view my certification [here](https://certificates.dev/vuejs/certificates/9ca17bca-7329-42a8-bd69-4bd7086c51ba).

### TypeScript Aficionado

I'm passionate about writing type-safe, robust code, and I've honed my TypeScript skills through various resources. One that I particularly enjoyed was the TypeScript workshops from Matt Pocock's [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/). These workshops have significantly enhanced my understanding and application of TypeScript in real-world scenarios.

### Web App Security Expert

I have a particular knack for web application security. As the main point of contact for security questions across multiple teams, I:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments
- 🛡️ Develop and implement security best practices
- 🧠 Educate teams on the latest security threats and mitigation strategies
- 🔍 Perform code reviews with a security-first mindset

My goal is to ensure that our web applications are not just functional and user-friendly, but also robust and secure against potential threats.

## The Geek: Multi-Faceted Enthusiast 🎲🎵🖌️

When I'm not pushing pixels, crafting Vue components, or fortifying web defenses, you'll find me indulging in my geeky pursuits:

### 🎲 Board Game & TTRPG Enthusiast
From intense zombie-slaying in Zombicide to strategic campaigns in Gloomhaven, I love diving into immersive tabletop experiences. I'm also taking my first steps into the world of TTRPGs!

### 💿 Vinyl Virtuoso
My collection of video game OSTs on vinyl is my pride and joy. Current favorite spin: *VA-11 HALL-A*

### 🎨 Miniature Maestro
Armed with brushes and paints, I meticulously craft miniature masterpieces. Each figurine tells a story, frozen in time and acrylic.

### 😺 Salesforce Plushie Collector
Yes, you read that right! I have an ever-growing collection of Salesforce mascot plushies. Current count: [Insert number] (and growing!)

## My Philosophy

> "In both code and games, it's all about solving puzzles, creating experiences, and ensuring a safe environment for all players."

This philosophy reminds me that whether I'm developing a secure Vue.js application, diving deep into TypeScript, or playing a board game, I'm always engaged in problem-solving, creating memorable experiences, and maintaining a secure and fair playing field.
